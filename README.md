# Development

## Development docs
Project status, design, and ticketing system are in these docs:
- `TODO.md` has the most concrete tasks, from statements about product features to concrete technical tickets.
- `DESIGN.md` has the overall product design.
- `NOTES.md` has developer notes regarding technical decisions, particularly icky bugs, etc.
- `planning/` has other notes and content, usually linked to by the top level .md docs.

## Setup

Start pyenv:
```sh
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"
```

Make venv:
```sh
pyenv virtualenv 3.10-dev mm310 && \
  pyenv activate mm310
```

Update pip:
```sh
python3.10 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

Install system dependencies:
```sh
brew install portaudio
```

Install Python requirements:
```sh
pip install .
```
This uses the `pyproject.toml`'s specified dependencies.

For a development installation, use the `-e` flag:
```sh
mkdir egg && \
    pip install -e .[dev,test]
```
Note that the `setup.cfg` puts the `.egg-info` into the local `./egg` directory; you have to create the `egg` dir first.

## Usage
After setting up, run:
```sh
python -m moshimoshi
```

## Tests
```bash
pytest -v -m 'not speak and not openai'
```

## Docs
```
python -m pydoc -b
```
