  Especially in this early alpha release, Moshi is developing rapidly.
  This page is an attempt to capture some of those updates for curious users.
  Please don't consider this complete or necessarily up to date - I'll do my best to keep you abreast of major changes.

  <li><tt>alpha-23.6.29; June 27, 2023</tt> Added privacy policy</li>
  <li><tt>alpha-23.6.30; June 28, 2023</tt> Added news page, updates to logging and CI in the backend in an attempt to make subsequent
